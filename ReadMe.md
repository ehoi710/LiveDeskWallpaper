# LiveDeskWallpaper

Live Desktop wallpaper writen by C++

to compile this, you need the following libraries:

* SDL2[^2.0.14]
* FFMPEG[^4.3.2]

enviroment is windows x64, but I think it can work x86 if you use the correct version of the library.

## How to use

```
LiveDeskWallpaper.exe wallpaper.mp4
```
